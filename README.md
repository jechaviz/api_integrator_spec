- Adhere to SOLID, DRY, KISS, and Dependency Injection principles in your code design.
- Don't document the code, just write it (maybe small parts of it).
- Manage errors with exceptions, with clear error messages.
- Use Clean Architecture principles but:
  - Try always to create only class that keeps the goodies of Clean Architecture.
  - To keep concerns separated, create a new class and refactor exisiting ones if really needed.
- Use python 3.12 goodies.
- Prefer dictionaries (with lambda functions) over if-elif statements for readability.
- Use snoop library for debugging.
- Add tests for all new code.
- Always give comments regarding enhancements, best practices, code design and pythonic stuff after modifying or adding code.
