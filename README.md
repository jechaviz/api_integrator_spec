## API Integration Convention
 
 This project utilizes a YAML-based configuration file to define the logic for integrating with external APIs. 
 The configuration file specifies actions, responses, and triggers, allowing for a flexible and reusable approach to API integration.
 This convention promotes consistency and maintainability across different API integrations.

### Key Features

**Schema Validation:**  A schema definition (e.g., using JSON Schema) is used to validate the YAML configuration files, ensuring they adhere to the expected structure and data types.
**Action Parameters:** Action parameters are separated from the action definition for better readability and maintainability.
**Sophisticated Response Handling:**  More advanced response validation mechanisms, such as regular expressions or JSONPath expressions, are used to handle complex responses.   
**Enhanced Error Handling:** Options for retrying actions, sending notifications, or triggering other actions based on specific error conditions are provided.
**Action Libraries:** Common actions are encapsulated in action libraries, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.
**Environment-Specific Variables:** A mechanism for defining environment-specific variables and constants is provided to support different deployment environments.
